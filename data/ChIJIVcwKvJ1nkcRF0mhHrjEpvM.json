We've went around 2 o'clock, altough one of our friends was a big Fan of Pacha Ibiza and we've booked one month before. Getting the tickets was a mascarade that took us 3 nights. We were calling them on the phone at 23 o'clock asking for the tickets \"Yes, we do have, come over here.\" Once we were there \"Sorry, no tickets for tonight. Come back tommorow\" So it took us 3 nights. Me and my friends we were totally disappointed. Even if the music was the only thing good, will never go there again.
